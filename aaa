"description":"Autism iHelp is a vocabulary teaching aid developed by parents of a child with Autism and a speech-language pathologist. Autism iHelp was inspired by the need for specific language intervention tools for children with Autism Spectrum Disorder focusing on their unique strengths and difficulty with expressive vocabulary.\nAutism iHelp is an invaluable tool for your child with Autism when those first words just don’t come. The colorful real-life photos are presented in an easy-to-label format. \nThis app includes several features:\n24 real world photos; it has been proven that children with Autism respond best to photos as opposed to illustrations and are very visual learners.  \n- 24 photos chosen based on established expressive language milestones are divided into three sub groups of eight.  With 24 photos, over-stimulation is less likely which increases the child’s ability to grasp the concepts at an appropriate rate.  \n\n - Labels of all photos with the option to turn off the label as some children with Autism may be more drawn to the written word. At the end of eight images there will be an option to try again, aiding in repetition and drill required for learning new words. \n\n - Option to have images presented at random or not, to additionally aid in generalization and concrete learning.   \nWhen audio is selected, two voice options are available—male and female.  This provides the most realistic experience for your child.  There will also be an option to turn the audio off, which would prompt your child to use his or her own voice and spontaneously label the learned words. \n\n - This app also includes two Learning Enhancement activities.  These learning activities are presented in a game-like format, and require the child to either match a picture to word given multiple word choices or choose the word that goes with the picture in a field of 4 pictures.  These games check retention of the learned vocabulary and integrate auditory and visual memory.  Additionally, you are able to track your child's gains through progress reports that average the last 3 performances of each learning enhancement activity.\n\nAutism iHelp - Play app offers engaging pictures of toys, outdoor activities, and arts and crafts often used in therapy or school.  \n\n“with Autism iHelp…..it gets better.”", "bundleId":"com.jt.autismhelpplay", "releaseNotes":"minor bug fixes.", "primaryGenreName":"Education", "isVppDeviceBasedLicensingEnabled":true, "releaseDate":"2012-04-28T03:30:45Z", "sellerName":"John Talavera", "genreIds":["6017", "6007"], "currentVersionReleaseDate":"2017-11-17T23:05:15Z", "averageUserRating":3.5, "userRatingCount":70},

Through routine learning, children learn labeling of concepts.  WH ?'s require incorporating more abstract thought and generalization in regard to the learned concepts.  Children with Autism often have difficulty with this particular skill, and Autism iHelp - WH?'s apps are an excellent way to target a vital educational benchmark in a mobile capacity.  \nAdditionally, you are able to track your child's gains through progress reports that average the last 3 performances of each learning enhancement activity.\n\n “with Autism iHelp…..it gets better.”", "bundleId":"com.jt.wh", "releaseNotes":"Minor bug fixes.", "primaryGenreName":"Education", "isVppDeviceBasedLicensingEnabled":true, "releaseDate":"2012-09-18T13:21:21Z", "sellerName":"John Talavera", "genreIds":["6017"], "currentVersionReleaseDate":"2017-10-26T01:30:21Z", "averageUserRating":3.5, "userRatingCount":84},

"description":"More than just a game, First Words Sampler is a powerful educational tool for toddlers and preschoolers.  It provides hours of fun while giving your child a head start on learning about letters and words.\n\nIf your child is old enough to ask for your phone, they're old enough for First Words Sampler!\n\nFirst Words Sampler teaches kids about letters, how letters relate to sounds, and even how to spell words.  First Words Sampler is toddler-tested and approved, with a user-interface designed specifically for the littlest of fingers. The game includes beautiful illustrations, each matched with entertaining sounds and high-quality recordings of letters and words.\n\nKids can play the game by themselves, but they also enjoy bringing their adults along, talking about the animals, saying the names of the letters, and watching the pictures spin around and sound off.\n\nThis free application is a sampling of words selected from our highly rated paid apps, First Words Animals and First Words Deluxe. We've also included some words from our Spanish, German, Japanese and French First Words apps. If you like First Words Sampler, you can keep your toddler laughing and learning with the full paid applications.\n\nNote: We love getting feedback and hearing stories about kids using our software.  Leave a comment in iTunes and send us feedback at learningtouch.com.  Tell us what you'd like to see us do next.", "bundleId":"com.clozure.learningtouch.FWSampler",

Autism iHelp was inspired by the need for specific language intervention tools for children with Autism Spectrum Disorder  focusing on their unique strengths and difficulty with expressive vocabulary.\nAutism iHelp is an invaluable tool for your child with Autism when those first words just don’t come. The colorful real-life photos are presented in an easy-to-label format. \nThis app includes 72 real world photos; it has been proven that children with Autism respond best to photos as opposed to illustrations and are very visual learners.  \nThis app also includes two Learning Enhancement activities.  These learning activities are presented in a game-like format. These games check retention of the learned vocabulary and integrate auditory and visual memory.  Additionally, you are able to track your child's gains through progress reports that average the last 3 performances of each learning enhancement activity.\nAutism iHelp colors is extremely unique when compared to any other first word learning apps.  This app includes groups of pictures categorized by specific color.  This app helps to distinguish and identify common items by color and allows for increased environmental generalization.  This helps the child with Autism to recognize that boundaries in regards to categorization are not exclusive.  Fortunately, the pictures for groups 'red' and 'yellow' are free of charge.\n“with Autism iHelp…..it gets better.”", "bundleId":"com.jt.AutismiHelpColors", "releaseNotes":"Latest iOS version support.", "primaryGenreName":"Education", "isVppDeviceBasedLicensingEnabled":true, "releaseDate":"2013-01-22T01:14:54Z", "sellerName":"John Talavera", "genreIds":["6017"], "currentVersionReleaseDate":"2017-12-19T21:10:23Z", "averageUserRating":3.5, "userRatingCount":15},

"description":"HIGHLIGHTS\n• Best Autism App of 2017 on the Healthline’s list\n• Used by over 120,000 children with ASD as a supplement to their regular therapy \n• Over 60,000 two-and three-year-old children are progressing through MITA on a daily basis\n• Includes unlimited language and cognitive exercises good for years of therapy\n• Recommended by hundreds of physicians for children with ASD starting from two years of age\n\nMental Imagery Therapy for Autism (MITA) is a unique, early-intervention application for children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). MITA includes bright, interactive puzzles designed to help children learn how to mentally integrate multiple features of an object, an ability proven to lead to vast improvements in general learning. Success with MITA could overtime result in significant improvements in a child’s overall development, specifically in the realms of language, attention and visual skills.  \n\nSCIENCE BEHIND THE PROJECT\n\n• Based on ABA technique of visual-visual and auditory-visual conditional discrimination.\n• Based on language therapy technique of following directions with increasing complexity.\n• Based on Pivotal Response Treatment that targets development of response to multiple cues. \n\nA child's ability to notice and to respond to multiple visual cues presented simultaneously is the most critical. This ability is typically impaired in individuals with autism, leading to what is commonly described as \"stimulus overselectivity\", or \"tunnel vision.\" Improving the capacity to respond to multiple cues has been shown to reduce stimulus overselectivity, which in turn leads to vast improvements in general learning. MITA aims to train mental integration and receptive language, starting with simple vocabulary, and progressing towards higher forms of language, such as adjectives, verbs, pronouns, and syntax.\n\nMITA in the news: https://youtu.be/giZymh3rMHc\nMITA research articles: https://goo.gl/28VCGg; http://goo.gl/lyHw95; https://goo.gl/nUpfNU; https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/xtj2z/\n\nMITA GAMES\n\n• Each game is adaptive and delivers exercises that are at the exact level of difficulty appropriate for your child at any given point in time\n• Animated characters and Playtime rewards will keep your child engaged while learning and having fun\n• Clean and intuitive interface with beautiful graphics that every child will love\n• No ads, no in-app-purchases\n\nMITA includes nine adaptive games that develop a child’s mental-integration ability as well as train their language functions. The visual exercises follow a systematic approach for developing a child's ability to notice multiple features of an object. MITA starts with simple exercises that teach a child to attend to only one feature, such as size (screenshot  #1) or color (#2). Over time, the exercises get more difficult and require the child to attend to two features simultaneously, such as both color and size (#3). Once a child has practiced attending to two features, the program moves on to puzzles that require attending to three features, such as color, size and shape (#4), and then eventually to puzzles that involve attending to an ever-increasing number of characteristics. \n\nThe verbal exercises in MITA also train your child’s mental integration ability. However these puzzles offer a more conventional, verbal approach to facilitating language acquisition, starting with simple vocabulary, and progressing towards higher forms of language (such as adjectives, prepositions, and syntax).\n\nMITA is designed for early childhood and intended for long-term, daily use. It is designed to be engaging and educational, as well as adaptive and responsive to the individual abilities of each child. \n\nMITA is developed by Dr. A. Vyshedskiy, a neuroscientist from Boston University; R. Dunn, a Harvard-educated early-child-development specialist; MIT-educated, J. Elgart and a group of award-winning artists and developers working alongside experienced therapists.", "bundleId":"com.imagiration.mita",
"releaseNotes":"Our new PlayTime rewards make it much easier to motivate your child to continue working with MITA therapy!\n\n1. We have added Drawing PlayTime for developing self-expression, motor skills & concentration. \n\n2. We’ve also added PBS Kids educational videos as a reward. Note: We only recommend the Video PlayTime reward if your child is not motivated otherwise. If you find that your child is satisfied with the other PlayTimes, please disable the Video PlayTime: Parent's Corner > Settings > PlayTime Settings.\n\n3. You are in full control of the number of PlayTimes your child receives as a reward. Simply open Parent’s Corner > Settings > PlayTime to change the number of rewards.\n\n4. We have added many more encouraging words and phrases spoken after each successful solution. \n\n5. New background melodies help the therapy feel more fun and playful. \n\n6. We have added some general improvements to the most difficult levels of the Language Game. \n\nHOW YOU CAN HELP:\n\nMITA is your chance to continue at-home therapy that is usually conducted by speech-language pathologists and ABA specialists. We truly believe that MITA can be a life changer for kids with autism as long as the therapy is started early and administered on a regular basis. We encourage you to spread the word! Please write a review in the app store, tell a friend, blog about it, tweet about it, and share your experience with your doctor.

The cost of the renewal will match the initial subscription price.\n\nWHAT’S NEW IN THIS ISSUE:\nThis will be specific to the issue.\n\nWHY WE CREATED THIS MAGAZINE:\nIf you are new to AADigest, we would like to thank you for taking the time to read this magazine, and welcome you into our community.\n\nPlease allow us a moment to tell you why we do this, and what we believe.\n\nFirst and foremost, we believe that we have been given an opportunity—a calling—to instill hope in parents, teachers, therapists, friends, and family members alike who work every day with kids with autism. Since most of the staff at AADigest have a child on the spectrum, we are like you—in a never-ending search for the best possible treatments, tips, and research that might improve the lives of our special children and ourselves. We also believe that we are on a special journey to experience things that families with neurotypical kids will never be given the opportunity to share. With this comes hard times and much work—sometimes with little to no perceivable steps forward—but the rewards are tremendous.\n\nWe have heard Temple Grandin speak at many conferences, and have come away with one undeniable truth: She embodies the “possibilities” for everyone in the room. That’s exactly WHY we created AADigest—to celebrate these hopes and possibilities. To share in our defeats and our triumphs. To stand together against what sometimes seem like insurmountable odds, while understanding that someone has gone before us and has succeeded. We firmly believe that’s why Temple is AADigest’s longest running columnist (11 years), and still writes for us to this day. She believes, like we do, that with understanding, testing, and trying, we can overcome most of the obstacles in our way.\n\nWe believe in giving our readers the very best information anywhere in the field of autism. We believe knowledge is power. And therein lies our WHY. It is our hope and belief that as we find and discover new ideas, the AADigest community should be the first to know about it. We believe that we become stronger by sharing information with our community, rather than going it alone.\n\nWe believe that parents, teachers, therapists, friends, and family members of spectrum kids are to be lifted up with praise for their tireless work. We believe in the ability, rather than the disability, of individuals. We believe in progress. We believe in courage, creativity, and dedication. We believe in always being curious. We believe in going beyond standard thinking. We believe in asking the hard questions. We believe in standing against the incorrect and the inaccurate. We believe in moving past established boundaries. We believe in helping one another. That’s WHY AADigest exists; it is the natural extension of what we believe.", "bundleId":"com.pixelmags.reader.managed.future-horizons-autism-digest",

"description":"Autism iHelp is a vocabulary teaching aid developed by parents of a child with Autism and a speech-language pathologist. Autism iHelp was inspired by the need for specific language intervention tools for children with Autism Spectrum Disorder focusing on their unique strengths and difficulty with expressive vocabulary. Autism iHelp - Phonological Awareness targets much-needed pre-reading concepts including identifying and differentiating sounds in words, hearing beginning and ending sounds, and mastering the skill of rhyming. Since many children with autism are often identified as 'word-callers,' exposure to metalinguistic practice involving phonological awareness is essential. Additionally, you are able to track your child's gains through progress reports that average the last 3 performances of each activity. “with Autism iHelp…..it gets better.”", "bundleId":"com.jt.AutismiHelpPA", "releaseNotes":"minor issue fixes.", "primaryGenreName":"Education", "isVppDeviceBasedLicensingEnabled":true, "releaseDate":"2013-08-05T17:21:07Z", "sellerName":"John Talavera", "genreIds":["6017"], "currentVersionReleaseDate":"2017-11-15T18:55:40Z", "averageUserRating":3.0, "userRatingCount":8},

"description":"The Autism Help App assists individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) and other disabilities to communicate and regulate in emergency situations.  Using the book: The Incredible 5-Point Scale TM by authors Kari Dunn Buron and Mitzi Curtis, AAPC Publishing the app helps individuals act, react and interact quickly in emergency situations. With a touch of a screen information is provided and can help facilitate interactions for a “safe” outcome for both the individual and 1st responder.\n\nUtilizing the 5 Point Scale, individuals can easily communicate and regulate their level of anxiety and take appropriate steps to be safe without the need to be verbal.  On the first screen levels are color-coded with different facial expressions, increasing based on the emergency or situation.  For example, choosing a “1” may mean “I have a scratch on my leg and need a band-aid.”  Choosing a “3” may mean “I have a headache and need to use my relaxation exercises.” Choosing a “5” may mean “I’m lost and can’t find my parents! I need a policeman.” Autism Help can be customized to fit an individual’s needs. Levels of “emergencies”, photos and responses can be individualized for each family. Photos of different emergency responders can be taken with your local First Responders so that the individual will recognize them, adding a mothers voice gives the individual immediate recognition to do something to be safe (“go to your safe place”). \n\nAutism Help can also be utilized as a learning tool to help individuals with ASD and other disabilities learn to interact depending upon the severity of the emergency. Photos based on the level of anxiety can be of a 1st responder for 5 or for level 1 a band-aid, or fidget, or stuffed animal, again each level can be customized with photos and voice recognition to “Your own “Autism Help” app. \n\nThe Autism Society of Minnesota, AuSM® with grant funds from the Minnesota Department of Human Services, has developed this app to support our mission of helping families by enhancing the lives of individuals with autism spectrum disorders through education, support, collaboration, and advocacy. Visit our website to learn more about available resources for Emergency Preparedness for families, 1st responders and individuals.", "bundleId":"org.ausm.aeps",

"description":"Inspire your baby to sign! Recommended by speech therapists, the adorable Baby Sign and Learn animated characters make signing so much fun! \n\nOne of the most fundamental human desires is to be understood - help your baby communicate by teaching her baby sign language. \n\nThe Baby Sign and Learn app features cute animated video demonstrations that will captive your child. Practice by playing the fun interactive quiz and inspire your baby to sign with the aid of the colorful flashcards.\n\nThis app uses keyword signs and allows you to specify your preferred sign language dialect. Supported signed languages include: American Sign Language (ASL), Australian Sign Language (Auslan), British Sign Language (BSL), Hong Kong Sign Language (HKSL) and New Zealand Sign Language (NZSL). \n\nThis app is free to allow you an opportunity to sample the many features and to try a few signs with your child. Then, if you would like to continue, please consider buying the full version which contains a great selection of baby's first signs. The full version can be purchased in the 'Unlock Signs' section of the app.\n\nWhat people are saying about Baby Sign and Learn:\n\n\"Simple format. Great animated graphics and some authentic voice overs make this one of the best toddler apps on the market!\" ~Static451\n\n\"I am enjoying it big time. My son even enjoys it he's only 15 months can sign bath and eat. He tries to do finish but he can't get his hand right, but he loves sitting there pressing it to watch the signs.\" ~T.L.\n\n\"The layout of your app is amazing to say the least and my one year old who already knows some signs was so into the babies signing instead of the adult that we see in most videos and other apps.\" ~Victoria\n\n\"My granddaughter is 6-months and when she sees my phone she reaches for it and pushes the buttons to see the babies...she loves to look at them\" ~Olivia\n\n\"Winner!\nI love this APP ! I looked for a long time before stumbling across this one, it is by far the BEST. I used to work in pediatrics & did a lot of co-treats with speech therapists & learned a lot from them. As they say, \"If you don't use it, you lose it\" , that happened to me. I especially love the feature of being able to watch the sign ! I highly recommend this for ANY parent/caregiver! Thank you for this incredible app!!\" ~Discojd\n\n\"Love this app\nMy whole family has learned so much from this app. I have 3 kids 8,7 & 3 years old and they are all learning with this. I have told other parents about it too!\" ~Mommy Renee\n\n\"Awesome\nMy baby loves this app. She has learned to communicate her needs quickly & loves to watch the babies.\" ~mamacita3\n\n\"Love it checked different apps and this one is the best! Everybody has fun learning sign language with this app. My children 1-10 years old love it!\" ~Mrs mom of five\n\nVisit http://www.babysignandlearn.com for more information about baby sign language.\n\nPlease Note: it has been stated in a recent review that one of the animated babies has a speech problem. While this was the case with a very early version of the app, it has been resolved for quite some time.

"description":"Autism iHelp is a vocabulary teaching aid developed by parents of a child with Autism and a speech-language pathologist. Autism iHelp was inspired by the need for specific language intervention tools for children with Autism Spectrum Disorder focusing on their unique strengths and difficulty with expressive vocabulary.\nAutism iHelp SHAPES is extremely unique when compared to any other first words learning apps.  This app includes groups of pictures categorized by specific shape.  This app helps distinguish and identify common items by shapes and allows increased environmental generalization.  This helps the child with Autism to recognize that boundaries in regards to categorization are not exclusive.\nThis app includes 64 real world photos; it has been proven that children with Autism respond best to photos as opposed to illustrations and are very visual learners\nThis app also includes two Learning Enhancement activities.  These learning activities are presented in a game-like format. These games check retention of the learned vocabulary and integrate auditory and visual memory.  Additionally, you are able to track your child's gains through progress reports that average the last 3 performances of each learning enhancement activity.\n\n “with Autism iHelp…..it gets better.”", "bundleId":"com.jt.AutismiHelpShapes", "releaseNotes":"Latest iOS version support.", "primaryGenreName":"Education", "isVppDeviceBasedLicensingEnabled":true, "releaseDate":"2013-03-27T00:09:55Z", "sellerName":"John Talavera", "genreIds":["6017"], "currentVersionReleaseDate":"2017-12-19T21:18:28Z"},

"description":"VAST-Autism provides unprecedented support for spoken language, combining evidence-based best practices and technology to deliver remarkable results.\n\nVAST-Autism is a groundbreaking tool that provides state-of-the-art therapy to students with autism and motor speech programming disorders such as apraxia. VAST-Autism combines the highly effective concept of video modeling with written words and auditory cues to help individuals acquire relevant words, phrases and sentences so that they can speak for themselves. For children and individuals with strong visual skills, this can be a key to developing speech.\n\nOngoing research and initial pilot studies indicate that students are highly interested in VAST videos, and will almost immediately attempt lip movements or touch their mouths in response to the models. After a few short weeks, many students who were essentially nonverbal began word approximations and word attempts more readily. Perhaps, the best and most unexpected therapeutic improvements have been in the students’ ability to generalize skills. Individuals may begin attending to the speaker’s oral motor movements during daily communication and continue learning speech in a traditional, naturalistic manner. \n\nThe mirror feature promotes oral motor sequencing and self-monitoring. Using a mirror while practicing speech sounds can provide visual feedback to help individuals improve their muscle coordination and sequencing for speech production.  Visual input can be an important source of feedback in developmental apraxia of speech.  Individuals should focus on how to produce the target sounds/words from a model and then observe and monitor their own attempts by using a mirror.\n\nAfter trialing the application with her students, Harumi Kato, MS, CCC-SLP said:\n\n“My students showed immediate results. To my surprise, after the FIRST trail, they started to vocalize some sounds.” \n\nVideos are organized into a hierarchy of 5 categories beginning with syllables and ending with sentences. Each video gives a spoken target utterance that is preceded by the written word(s). Each word, phrase and sentence is concrete and has meaning that can be generalized and practiced throughout the day. Providing the written word will prevent a student from labeling a picture of a frog jumping as \"go,\" a person laying on a mat as \"break time\" or labeling a swing as \"weee.\" The ability to recognize the written target word(s) will increase functional communication and enhance acquisition of spoken language. The progression of VAST-Autism Videos is as follows:\n\n1. Syllable Repetition\n2. Single Syllable Words\n3. Multi-Syllabic Words\n4. Phrases\n5. Sentences\n\nThis “Core” app represents the first release of the VAST-Autism program. We intend to expand upon this offering through future applications and via the SpeakinMotion web-based platform.\n\nAs it becomes available, we will provide more extensive information about the application and professional guidance surrounding its use on the web at:\n\nwww.speakinmotion.com\n\nand\n\nwww.proactivespeechtherapy.com\n\nRESEARCH\n\nVideo Modeling- A significant amount of research has shown video modeling to be rapid and highly effective not only in teaching new behaviors, but also in generalizing and maintaining these behaviors as well.\n\nVisual Language and Literacy- Children and adults on the spectrum who have difficulty with speaking and writing, can learn to read and spell. The ability to read increases functional communication. Information that is not understood auditorally may be easily processed visually. Providing written word(s) to individuals with autism also prevents mislabeling concepts, for example, a car would not be labeled \"beep beep.\"", "bundleId":"com.speakinmotion.autism.core1", "releaseNotes":"Updates to support iOS7 - fixing some iOS7 bugs that prevented proper video orientation.", "primaryGenreName":"Education", "isVppDeviceBasedLicensingEnabled":false, "releaseDate":"2011-03-22T20:13:59Z", "sellerName":"SpeakinMotion, LLC", "genreIds":["6017", "6020"], "currentVersionReleaseDate":"2013-10-20T01:07:05Z", "averageUserRating":3.5, "userRatingCount":45},

"description":"The Social Skills for Autism App “Mission Rescue Kloog” is designed for tablets only and teaches children, adolescents and teenagers with autism and asperger syndrome social skills in a fun and reward driven way. The app has 17 individual lesson plans with each one covering a required social skill. Please view the screenshots below for a complete list of the lesson plans. It is highly recommended that the user completes the app with the assistance of a parent, guardian, Teacher or assistant to maximise both learning and comprehension. It’s also great fun and a really nice way to learn together. \nThe app is both creative and innovative and introduces the concept of content sensitivity for the user. Understanding is constantly tested during the app with a series of fun quizzes and “Let’s Discuss” sections throughout the app where the user discusses what they have learned and the user can also unlock a reward each time they complete a lesson plan. \nThe app is based around a central character called Kloog the alien whose spaceship crash lands on Earth. Kloog is totally unfamiliar with our social skills and customs. The app user must help Kloog who is a slightly clumsy but lovable alien through the series of 17 lesson plans, let's discuss sections and quizzes so that he can get parts and fuel for his ship and return to his home planet. The app is also fun and reward driven as the user unlocks a part for Kloog’s ship each time they successfully complete a lesson plan and can also unlock a funny video featuring Kloog once the user completes a full mission.\nThe Social Skills for Autism app has been developed by the Shine Centre for Autism in Ireland and is based on the very successful “PALS” (Personal & Life Skills Programme) that has been running at the Centre since 2010.", "bundleId":"com.rescue.kloog", "primaryGenreName":"Education", "isVppDeviceBasedLicensingEnabled":true, "releaseDate":"2015-04-20T00:23:33Z", "sellerName":"IRISH PROGRESSIVE ASSOCIATION FOR AUTISM COMPANY LIMITED", "genreIds":["6017", "6016"], "currentVersionReleaseDate":"2015-04-20T00:23:33Z", "averageUserRating":2.0, "userRatingCount":7},

"description":"Take the guess work out of parenting and discover the joy of knowing what your baby has to say before she can talk! One of the most fundamental human desires is to be understood - help your baby communicate by teaching her baby sign language.\n\nThis app is free to allow you an opportunity to sample the many features and to try a few signs with your child. Then, if you would like to continue, please consider buying the full version which contains approx. 340 signs and over 1 hour of video instruction. The full version is available for purchase on the App Store.\n\nThis app includes 40 real-life signing video demonstrations! The friendly presenters in the 'ASL dictionary by Baby Sign and Learn' app will help you to learn to sign with your baby in an engaging and enjoyable way.\n\nThe keyword signs demonstrated in this video dictionary are based on American Sign Language (ASL). All signs have been carefully selected for their ease of use, helpfulness to carers and appropriateness for baby's interests and daily routine.\n\nEach sign has a detailed video tutorial covering information such as: simple instructions on how to perform the sign, clever tips to help you remember the sign and practical suggestions on how to introduce the sign to your baby.\n\nThe signs are also organized into categories such as: action words, animals, daily routines, feelings and emotions, food, manners and behavior, and nature – all of which are arranged alphabetically for quick and easy searching.\n\nTo test your baby signing knowledge, the app also comes with a fun interactive video quiz that will help you learn and remember the signs. You can also mark signs as part of your favorites list.\n\nOther key features:\n     • high quality graphics and videos optimized for viewing on Retina displays.\n     • optional setting to allow continuous play through of all signs in a category.\n     • swipe through the signs in a category without returning to the menu.\n     • optional setting to view a simplified demonstration for a sign rather than the complete tutorial.\n\nThis app makes the perfect parent's companion to the popular 'Baby Sign and Learn' animated apps (also available on the App Store).

"description":"What image comes to your mind when you hear the word ‘Square’ and ‘Blue’? Get to learn about all the shapes and colors with the help of an app called iLNE Spell 2 L – Autism Series. WebTeam Corporation has designed this app to help children on the spectrum learn about different shapes and colors in an interactive way.\n\nThe app offers rewards for each correct response, and lets the user share his/her score on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nABA & iLearnNEarn App Series\n=====================\nAs we know, the recommendation of 40 hours per week of ABA programming as employed by Lovaas’s study has been cited by many parents as being vital to their child’s success. The National Research Council’s 2001 report (p. 184) summarizes the skills necessary for implementing an effective ABA program as: \n\n “Teachers must be familiar with theory and research concerning best practices for children with autistic spectrum disorders, including methods of applied behavior analysis, naturalistic learning, incidental teaching, assistive technology, socialization, communication, inclusion, adaptation of the environment, language interventions, assessment, and the effective use of data collection systems. Specific problems in generalization and maintenance of behaviors also affect the need for training in methods of teaching children with autistic spectrum disorders. The wide range of IQ scores and verbal skills associated with autistic spectrum disorders, from profound mental retardation and severe language impairments to superior intelligence make the need for training of personnel even greater.” \n\niLearnNEarn offers series of apps based on ABA which help parents and teachers with minimum knowledge of theory. These apps provide supplemental intervention and are delivered through mobile device, tablets and iPads. It also helps introduce generalization in different settings. \n\nThe content is reviewed and approved by the expert educators and researchers from the Autism industry and are based on ABA therapy (the only scientifically-validated treatment for children with developmental disabilities, special education needs or autism).", "bundleId":"com.webteamcorp.com.iLNESpell2Free", "primaryGenreName":"Education", "isVppDeviceBasedLicensingEnabled":true, "releaseDate":"2012-10-18T23:21:38Z", "sellerName":"WebTeam Corporation", "genreIds":["6017", "6013"], "currentVersionReleaseDate":"2012-10-18T23:21:38Z"},

"description":"Welcome to Toca Life: Pets, where you and your animal friends run the show! What’s your favorite pet like? Furry and fast? Wet and wiggly? A little bit creepy? With more than 120 animals, Toca Life: Pets has every kind of pet you can imagine.\n\nEXPLORE FIVE LOCATIONS\n\nPET PARK: Enjoy the great outdoors with the pets! Take a dip in the river, have a picnic on the grass, play a game or discover a hidden cave. Or build an agility course to train your pets and test their skills. Poke around a bit, explore the tree — you might find some surprises to expand your pet family!\n\nPET HOTEL: Sometimes families go on trips without their pets, but thanks to the pet hotel, pets get a vacation of their own! With lots of cozy spaces, an aquarium and outdoor space, every pet will find a nice spot to play or relax — dog or cat, bird or sloth-bat!\n\nVETERINARY: The vet can help sick pets feel better and help healthy pets stay that way! You’ll find pills, drops and the instruments needed to operate on sick or injured pets. Pets can play outdoors or wait on the cozy beds until the vet is ready to see them.\n\nPET SHOP: Find everything you need for to groom, feed, play with and care for your pets at the pet shop. After shopping, grab a bite to eat at the pet shop cafe, where pets get a table too!\n\nBREEDER’S BUNGALOW: Here’s where the pet breeder starts and ends their day. The bungalow is, of course, filled with pets — hiding in the greenhouse and playing in the yard and splashing in mud. Don’t worry, the giant bathtub gets everyone clean again!\n\nENJOY A FREE GIFT\nBundled with Toca Life: Pets is a free pack of 18 exclusive iMessage stickers! Add pet stickers to your messages to express yourself in a fun way.\n\nFEATURES\nRole-play in five locations: pet park, pet hotel, veterinary, pet shop and breeder’s bungalow.\n- Meet 23 new characters.\n- Play with and care for 124 real and fantasy animals. \n- Bathe muddy pets and get them clean again!\n- Pretend to be a vet and care for sick and injured pets.\n- Dress your pets in fun hats — stack hats on hats on hats!\n- Pets can pee and poop!\n- Keep spaces clean by cleaning up all the pet poop!\n- Poop is also stackable! Stack the poop high, bag it up and discard!\n- Build an agility course to train pets and help them get the exercise they need.\n- Pull the branch in the pet park to discover a surprise!\n\nLIGHTS, CAMERA, ACTION!\nUse the in-app recording feature to create an original video! This feature records your voice and your characters’ movements as you’re telling the story. Create videos up to two minutes long and save them to your camera roll to share your storytelling later! \n\nGET INSIDER INFO EACH WEEK\nDon’t miss Life Weekly! This is your source for funny videos, insider tips and cool fan art from kids around the world. Tap the lightbulb in the top right corner of the start screen to get updates every week. This free feature gives you fun insights into the world of Toca Life!\n\nAbout Us:\nAt Toca Boca, we believe in the power of play to spark kids’ imaginations and help them learn about the world.

"description":"Today sale 25% off! \nAbby's Train - Learning colors is a new app from a series developed by a team of educational experts from 22learn designed to best prepare your children for success in the kindergarten curriculum. Its simple, yet modifiable, child-friendly interface offers children an engaging way to master the essential skill of color identification and vocabulary. \n\n*** \"This app provided a perfect practice for my daughter. Thanks to it, she is already one step ahead of her peers. And I wish you could see how much she loves the monkey!\" *** Janet R., a mother of two.\n\n*** \"Very effective and engaging way to teach colors.\" *** Richard W., a kindergarten teacher.\n\n*** \"That is so cool! Sticker, sticker!\" *** Martin, beta-tester, 3 years.\n\nWe at 22learn understand that each child develops at his or her own pace and has unique needs, the application, therefore, allows parents / teachers both to modify the maximum number of colored objects (1-10) the child will be choosing from and the targeted educational content in a form of particular colors to be learned (blue, red, yellow, green, orange, pink, purple, black, white, grey, and brown). In this way, the application can be tailored to suit the needs of precisely your child!\nTo make the game more engaging, the child's task is to place an object (various toys etc.) of a particular color into a train. After each level accomplished (three objects correctly placed into the train), the child can choose a sticker as a reward.\n\n*** \"Yeah, green! Got a sticker!\" *** Adam, beta-tester, 3.5 years.\n\nFor further reinforcement of motivation to learn in a stimulating and friendly environment, the monkey character is there always ready to enthusiastically praise children for all their efforts. Children will love the monkey jumping out of joy accompanied by fun sound effects when they get a correct response!\nMoreover, the game keeps children challenged as it gets progressively more difficult after each level -- the number of objects to choose from approaches the maximum number as modified in the Settings.\nTo allow for natural learning development, we recommend parents to first pick just the colors the child already knows, and then gradually add new colors to be learned. At first, it is best when the child chooses only from two or three colors, and the range of targeted colors is enlarged subsequently.\nBased on our two decades of experience in the educational field, we made every effort to make sure that the design of this app is as easy-to-use for this special age category as possible, and that the whole app is both fun and educational.

"description":"* Finalist for the BestAppEver Award: Toddler Apps *\n \nThe best-selling reading game for kids has gotten even better! We've added more words, more languages, and phonics. First Words Deluxe provides endless fun for the toddlers in your life, all while giving your child a head start on learning their letters and learning to spell words.\n\nNow with Spanish, French, German, Japanese, plus US and UK English.\n\nFirst Words Deluxe is toddler-tested and approved, with a user-interface designed specifically for the littlest of fingers.  The game includes over 150 words in five kid-friendly categories:\n\n** Animals **\n** Vehicles **\n** Colors **\n** Shapes **\n** Words from around the house **\n\n(Fewer words are shown when the phonics option is selected, because many English words are not spelled phonetically.  A total of 68 phonics words are included.)\n\nA wide range of options let you tune the game to match your child's current skills and abilities.\n\nIf your child is old enough to ask for your phone, they're old enough for First Words Deluxe!\n\nHere's what educators and reviewers have said about our First Words apps: \n\n“First Words is an app that teaches letters and words in fun and interactive way. Very easy to use these apps will help support your little ones learning with great illustrations and bright colors. Each app supports kids learning and encourages kids to explore and discover by revealing, rewarding and teaching.” \n-- Fun Educational Apps \n\n“Excellent - As a teacher, I love this game! Just what technology was meant to do!” \n-- iTunes Review \n\n“This app has great settings that let you control the level of difficulty for the child – either with lots of hints or almost none at all. The letters slide nicely into each word and when completed the child is rewarded by having the pictured animal enlarge and animate briefly.” \n--Carisa Kluver at Digital Stortyime \n\n“First Words Deluxe is a very straightforward word-building game. Words are either said letter by letter as they are dragged into the appropriate gray boxes or, if chosen in the settings, a smaller set of words can be sounded out with phonics. This makes this game a treat for both pre-readers and early spellers.” \n--Common Sense Media \n\n“Looking to guide your toddler towards recognizing letters and how to spell words up to eight letters long? Then First Words Deluxe might be just what you are looking for. This pre-reader and spelling application encourages vocabulary development in a wide range of categories such as: vehicles, animals, at home, colors, and shapes.” \n--Andrea Gardner at Applicable2u \n\n\"First Words is a great app -- as I said at the time, 'Leo loves First Words because it's fun and easy. I love it because he's learning to spell words, and the interface makes that learning error-free.'\" \n---Shannon Des Roches Rosa at Squidalicious \n\n*** We love getting feedback from our users.

"description":"An amazing app for easily creating, sharing and printing educational social stories, visual schedules, and beautiful memories.\n\nThis is a very valuable tool for any teacher, SLP, OT, direct care staff or parent! \n\nChildren with special needs often need more direct instruction of social skills.

This social stories found in this app use simple text and descriptive pictures to explain the why and how of different social skills. \n\nSocial interactions may be especially difficult for children with an autism spectrum disorder, adhd, or other social delay. Many children, especially those diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder, Down syndrome and other special need, often fail to pick up on social cues, making learning a social skill especially difficult. Social stories may increase awareness and maintenance of social skills. \n\nSocial stories were first defined by Carol Gray in 1991 and are commonly used to break down a task or social situation into small and easy to understand steps, often accompanied by descriptive pictures. Social stories are incredibly easy to implement and are used by many professionals for a wide range of behaviors.\n\nSee what our reviews are saying about us!\n\n“Wonderful app!!

Practice bathroom routines like wiping, flushing, and washing & drying hands before returning to play.\n·Build blocks with Daniel.

"description":"This colorful, educational vocabulary App for the iPhone®, iPad®, and iPod touch® has all 52 illustrated picture flash cards (plus audio of each card text) from the Let's Name Things Fun Deck® by Super Duper® Publications. Select the cards you want students to see, and have them name items to practice vocabulary, categorizing, and thinking skills. The prompts include statements like, “Let’s name… things that live in the ocean.” and “Let’s name… things you’d take on a trip.”\n\nThis App is simple to use — each student looks at an illustration, and either reads the prompt or touches the screen to listen to the prompt. The student then gives a verbal response. After each answer, tap the green (correct) or red (incorrect) button to score the student’s verbal response. Move to the next card by sliding the card currently on the display screen to the side. To move to the next player, tap the bar at the top of the screen and select a name. You can also advance cards and players automatically by selecting the Auto-Advance option in the Settings menu. You can leave a game by selecting End from the menu. To return to the game, select Resume from the main menu. When you finish, view the results in a graph, and print or email your data.\n\nLet’s Name… Things Fun Deck® App lets you: \n• Use the app in portrait or landscape orientation. \n• Select all 52 cards or just the ones you want students to see. \n• Track correct and incorrect responses for an unlimited number of players. \n• Advance players and cards manually or automatically.\n• Receive feedback for incorrect and/or correct responses\n• Discontinue game play and continue at any time.\n• View results in a graph and see which questions a player missed during a session.\n• Print, E-mail and share your results.", "bundleId":"com.superduperinc.Let-s-Name-Things", "releaseNotes":"This update contains stability and performance improvements.", "primaryGenreName":"Education", "isVppDeviceBasedLicensingEnabled":true, "releaseDate":"2011-08-10T07:00:00Z", "sellerName":"Super Duper, Inc.", "genreIds":["6017", "6014"], "currentVersionReleaseDate":"2017-11-17T14:29:33Z", "averageUserRating":3.5, "userRatingCount":93},

"description":"Autism iHelp is a vocabulary teaching aid developed by parents of a child with Autism and a speech-language pathologist. Autism iHelp was inspired by the need for specific language intervention tools for children with Autism Spectrum Disorder  focusing on their unique strengths and difficulty with expressive vocabulary.\n\nAutism iHelp is an invaluable tool for your child with Autism when those first words just don’t come. The colorful real-life photos are presented in an easy-to-label format. \n\nThis app includes several features:\n\n- 24 real world photos; it has been proven that children with Autism respond best to photos as opposed to illustrations and are very visual learners. 24 photos chosen based on established expressive language milestones are divided into three sub groups of eight.  With 24 photos, over-stimulation is less likely which increases the child’s ability to grasp the concepts at an appropriate rate. \n- Labels of all photos with the option to turn off the label as some children with Autism may be more drawn to the written word. At the end of eight images there will be an option to try again, aiding in repetition and drill required for learning new words. \n- Option to have images presented at random or not, to additionally aid in generalization and concrete learning.\n- When audio is selected, two voice options are available—male and female.  This provides the most realistic experience for your child.  There will also be an option to turn the audio off, which would prompt your child to use his or her own voice and spontaneously label the learned words. \n- This app also includes two Learning Enhancement activities.  These learning activities are presented in a game-like format, and require the child to either match a picture to word given multiple word choices or choose the word that goes with the picture in a field of 4 pictures.  These games check retention of the learned vocabulary and integrate auditory and visual memory. Additionally, you are able to track your child's gains through progress reports that average the last 3 performances of each learning enhancement activity.\n\nAutism iHelp Home app includes common household items for dining and objects from the bathroom and family room. These everyday things can be used for requesting, labeling, or using as a communication aid.\n\n“with Autism iHelp…..it gets better.”", "bundleId":"com.jt.autismhelphome", "releaseNotes":"Latest iOS version support.", "primaryGenreName":"Education", "isVppDeviceBasedLicensingEnabled":true, "releaseDate":"2012-02-20T17:34:00Z", "sellerName":"John Talavera", "genreIds":["6017", "6007"], "currentVersionReleaseDate":"2017-11-21T00:03:15Z", "averageUserRating":4.0, "userRatingCount":15},

"description":"J A N U R I or January? How do you spell months? Most of us get stuck somewhere or the other while spelling months. Start spelling months correctly with the help of iLNE Spell 1 L – Autism Series app. WebTeam Corporation has designed this app to help children on the spectrum spell all the months accurately in an easy and interactive way.\n\nThe In-App version of iLNE Spell 1 L – Autism Series allows your child to play and learn at the same time. Still confused about whether it should be 'i' or 'y'?\n\n“Teachers must be familiar with theory and research concerning best practices for children with autistic spectrum disorders, including methods of applied behavior analysis, naturalistic learning, incidental teaching, assistive technology, socialization, communication, inclusion, adaptation of the environment, language interventions, assessment, and the effective use of data collection systems. Specific problems in generalization and maintenance of behaviors also affect the need for training in methods of teaching children with autistic spectrum disorders. The wide range of IQ scores and verbal skills associated with autistic spectrum disorders, from profound mental retardation and severe language impairments to superior intelligence make the need for training of personnel even greater.” \n\nThe content is reviewed and approved by the expert educators and researchers from the Autism industry and are based on ABA therapy (the only scientifically-validated treatment for children with developmental disabilities, special education needs or autism).\n\n***About WebTeam Corporation***\n\nIncorporated in 2005, WebTeam Corporation is a Somerset-based mobile application development firm that has pioneered the development of an autism management program comprising screening, assessment and intervention apps. WebTeam’s ABA-based autism apps help parents, teachers, health care experts, researchers and other stakeholders worldwide efficiently manage the entire life-cycle of autism from infancy to adulthood and employment.\n\nBy developing apps for autism intervention, WebTeam replicates individualized autism services on mobile devices, thereby making these necessary services available to the under-served population globally, especially in countries that lack the expertise necessary to tackle autism efficiently and in a cost-effective manner.\n\nWebTeam’s innovative idea backed by proprietary technology, which was awarded by Verizon in the 2013 Powerful Answers Award competition, lets caregivers collect and share data efficiently to foster effective collaborations that will ultimately solve one of the world’s largest and growing developmental disorders.\n\nNote: You will need Wi-Fi connectivity to download and use this app.", "bundleId":"com.webteamcorp.com.iLNESpell1Free", "releaseNotes":"Compatible up to iOS version 6.0", "primaryGenreName":"Education", "isVppDeviceBasedLicensingEnabled":true, "releaseDate":"2012-09-14T22:50:37Z", "sellerName":"WebTeam Corporation", "genreIds":["6017", "6013"], "currentVersionReleaseDate":"2012-10-16T23:53:43Z"},

"description":"Welcome to “Spanish First Words with Phonics“ the first educational application to teach children Spanish through letter sounds (phonics) and letter names, that also provides the choice between distinción or seseo. Your child will start off by learning the sounds of letters through phonics (distinción or seseo mode) and how these associate to specific words. As your child’s understanding of the sounds and names broadens your child will move on to learn the names of the letters (distinción or seseo mode) and how they are used to form words, learning spelling at the same time. The three different hint alternatives (color hints, letter hints and color and letter hints) combined with five more settings, will challenge your child and adjust the level of difficult. The unique interface, featuring a list of thumbnails, allows your child to explore all the words and will offer endless hours of fun and education. \n\nFeatured by Apple on New & Noteworthy and What’s Hot for the iPhone on the US, Spanish, and Chilean App Stores in two categories Games/Educational and Games/Kids! \n\n________________________________\nDISTINCIÓN OR SESEO MODE (“THETA” OR “S”) \n\n“Spanish First Words with Phonics“ is the first educational application to teach children reading through letter sound (phonics) and letter names that provides the choice between distinción or seseo (differentiated pronunciation of ‹s› and ‹z› or ‹c›) by a simple change in the corresponding button in the settings of the game.

"description":"Dr. Gary Brown's Autism/DTT Numbers app uses Discrete Trial Training (DTT) to help your child learn the numbers (0-99) and to learn to count (0-9).  (This app is currently English only.  Check the support page for more info.)\n\nThis app has been tested extensively in Dr. Brown's clinic with children who have autism, ADHD, and other developmental disorders.  DTT is not a children's game. It is a therapy based on years of scientific research.  DTT is the primary teaching method used in Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) to teach numerous pre-academic and social skills to children with autism.  This app can be used to help teach numbers and counting to children with autism, attention deficit disorder (ADD), or attention deficit hyperactive disorder (ADHD).  The apps also can be used by any child who has trouble staying on task.\n\nFinding the right therapy for a child with autism can be overwhelming.  Only Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) has years of scientific research proving its effectiveness and is recommended by The National Institute of Mental Health and the Surgeon General.  But caregivers quickly learn that well-trained therapists in ABA are expensive and hard to find.  During my forty years of clinical experience as a Licensed Psychologist I have tried to provide low-cost ABA resources for caregivers so they can do their own ABA.  ABA and DTT increases your child's likelihood of being mainstreamed, increases happiness, and gives you hope.\n\nBe sure to check out our other DTT and autism apps: \n* Autism/DTT Colors \n* Autism/DTT Shapes \n* Autism/DTT Letters \n* Autism/DTT Site Words \n* Autism/DTT Animals \n* Autism/DTT People \n* Autism DX/Treatment\n* DTT Pro", "bundleId":"net.zbobbradley.dttnumbers", "releaseNotes":"Updated for iOS8 and iPhone 6 and 6Plus devices.", "primaryGenreName":"Education", "isVppDeviceBasedLicensingEnabled":true, "releaseDate":"2011-04-11T15:48:52Z", "sellerName":"Bob Bradley", "genreIds":["6017", "6020"], "currentVersionReleaseDate":"2015-05-12T13:06:46Z", "averageUserRating":3.5, "userRatingCount":9},

We work on identifying emotions and feelings in themselves and others.\" \n\"I work with students who have ASD and this would be a great app to try out in my schools.\" \n\"Fantastic for helping children with special needs understanding feelings, what a great teaching tool.\" \n\nImmerse your child into the world of feelings and emotions. iTouchiLearn Feelings gives preschool, kindergarten and children with special needs the social cues needed to identify, interpret and communicate their emotions. By interacting with words and associated visual actions, children step through the process that causes an emotion. \n\niTouchiLearn Feelings gives children tools to express their feelings and emotions through: \n\n*Funny animations that demonstrate cause and effect feelings and emotions \n*Six fun activities that identify core feelings and improve communication skills \n*Audio directions to facilitate learning and aid children with speech difficulties \n*Ideal supplement for play and speech therapy \n*Bonus animated sing-a-long happy song \n*Post Feelings Face Creation to Facebook to share with family and friends!\n\nTouchiLearn Feelings sequentially builds early learning social cues and enables children to apply what they learn to real world situations. \n\niTouchiLearn Feelings is most effective when you begin by playing with your child and guiding them through the activity. As they become more familiar with the structure of the games, children can play alone and build early learning and social competency skills. \n\nCompatible with 3rd Generation & higher iPod touch, iPhone 3GS, 4 & 4S, iPad 1 & iPad 2 \n\nTouchiLearn Feelings is brought to you by Staytoooned creators of the the popular iPhone/iPad iTouchiLearn Words for Preschool Kids app featured in iTunes \"Apps for Kids\". \n\nPlease support us by giving us feedback, high ratings and reviews! This encourages us to keep updating iTouchiLearn Feelings with new features so you can reap the benefits! \n\nWe are committed to providing you with the best user experience.

"description":"APP UPDATED FOR iOS 6 and iPhone 5.\n----------------------------------\n\nHelp your child learn the sight words using Dr. Gary Brown's DTT Words!  Sight words are the first words that your child should learn to recognize.  This version of DTT Words includes hundreds of sight words for preschool, kindergarten, first, second and third grade children.  Each word can be spoken by either a male or female voice, and then your child can select the word from a list of words shown on the screen.   (This app is currently English only.)\n\nThis app has been tested extensively in Dr. Brown's clinic with children who have autism, ADHD, and other developmental disorders.  DTT (Discrete Trial Training) is not a children's game. It is a therapy based on years of scientific research.  DTT is the primary teaching method used in Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) to teach numerous pre-academic and social skills to children with autism.  This app can be used to help teach sight words to children with autism, attention deficit disorder (ADD), or attention deficit hyperactive disorder (ADHD).  The apps also can be used by any child who has trouble staying on task.\n\nFinding the right therapy for a child with autism can be overwhelming.  Only Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) has years of scientific research proving its effectiveness and is recommended by The National Institute of Mental Health and the Surgeon General.  But caregivers quickly learn that well-trained therapists in ABA are expensive and hard to find.  During my forty years of clinical experience as a Licensed Psychologist I have tried to provide low-cost ABA resources for caregivers so they can do their own ABA.  ABA and DTT increases your child's likelihood of being mainstreamed, increases happiness, and gives you hope.\n\nBe sure to check out our other apps: \n* Autism Colors\n* Autism/DTT Shapes\n* Autism/DTT Letters\n* Autism/DTT Numbers\n* Autism/DTT Animals\n* Autism/DTT People", "bundleId":"net.zbobbradley.dttsitewords", "releaseNotes":"DTT Words has been upgraded to use the  DTT Pro core shell.

"description":"Proloquo2Go is an award-winning symbol-based communication app that gives a voice to those who cannot speak. Over 175,000 people already use this AAC app as a powerful tool for expressing themselves and increasing their communication skills and language development. Its innovative features let users, parents, teachers and therapists quickly personalize the app.\n\nProloquo2Go is an AAC (Augmentative and Alternative Communication) app used by people with autism, Down syndrome, cerebral palsy and other diagnoses. It is available in English, Spanish, French, and Dutch for iPad, iPhone, iPod touch and Apple Watch.\n\n“Users can open Proloquo2Go and begin to use it for effective communication immediately” – Susan Berkowitz, MS-SLP, AAC Consultant.\n\nFeature highlights\n\n• Crescendo™, a complete research-based core word vocabulary with 10,000+ fringe words\n\n• Quickly and easily customizable – everything from the vocabulary to the appearance \n\n• Designed for a range of fine-motor and visual skills with options like 23 pre-programmed grid sizes\n \n• Use your regional vocabulary and accent with British, Australian and American English, Parisian and Canadian French, Castilian and American Spanish, and Dutch and Flemish. The app also supports bilingual use, and you can even switch languages mid-sentence\n\n• 100 natural-sounding free voices across all languages, including children’s voices\n\n\nResearch-based\n\nProloquo2Go puts the user’s development first with features based on clinical knowledge and user research. Studies show that just 200-400 words make up 80% of what we say – known as core words. Combined with best practices like modeling, teaching core words has been shown to grow  language and communication skills. Our Crescendo™ vocabulary is based on this insight and puts core words front and center for easy access. \n\nGrows communication skills\n\nProloquo2Go is one of the few AAC apps designed to support all users, from beginning to advanced. This lets someone develop from single words to full grammatical sentences in the same app. With over 10,000 words available, there’s no limit on what you can say. Our Progressive Language feature reveals words step by step. This helps communicators learn words and their location as their vocabulary gradually grows.\n\nResearch has shown that consistent placement of objects supports easy recognition, known as motor planning. With this in mind, Proloquo2Go's thematic templates keep core words in the same places throughout the vocabulary. This helps communicators by reducing time wasted trying to find words.\n\nEasy customization and accessibility\n\nButtons, pages, navigation and access - the whole app is customizable. With just a few taps, you can make it suit both vocabulary and accessibility needs. For the most important things to you, you can add your own buttons. The app comes with more than 25,000 symbols for new words – but you can use your own photos too. Accessibility settings support scanning and Apple’s VoiceOver,  for users with fine-motor challenges and vision impairments. These make the app work with how you’re comfortable using it.\n\nComprehensive support\n\nWith Proloquo2Go, you get more than an app – we’re there for you every step of the way. Our website has free e-learning videos and PDF tutorials, and the Assistiveware Core Word Classroom includes resources for using AAC effectively. You can also connect directly with our AAC community on our Facebook groups. And for any questions you might have, our support team is available by email 7 days a week, and is always happy to help.\n\nDiscounts available with Apple’s educational Volume Purchase Program – 50% off on 20 licenses or more. Joan Bruno’s Gateway to Language & Learning© vocabulary is available as in-app purchase (English only).", "bundleId":"com.assistiveware.proloquo2go",
"releaseNotes":"This update introduces the first genuine Dutch Text to Speech voices by and for children, Merel and Thijs. We spent nearly a year creating these voices in collaboration with Acapela Group and NSGK, and we’re very happy to be able to offer young Dutch AAC users voices which they can identify with.\n\nThe voices are included in this update for all Proloquo2Go users and can easily be used along voices in other languages for bilingual users. The children’s voices also add another level to Proloquo2Go’s support for the Netherlands and Belgium, with region-specific vocabularies and 9 adult Text to Speech voices - 4 Dutch and 5 Flemish.\n\n\nThis version also includes improvements from version 5.4:\n• iPhone X compatibility \n• Backups over 4GB can now be restored\n\nThanks for using our app!", "primaryGenreName":"Education", "isVppDeviceBasedLicensingEnabled":true, "releaseDate":"2009-04-21T21:38:18Z", "sellerName":"AssistiveWare B.V.", "genreIds":["6017", "6020"], "currentVersionReleaseDate":"2018-02-26T09:20:36Z", "averageUserRating":4.5, "userRatingCount":1922},

How does your plant behave when it’s soaking wet?\n\n● Nutrition station: What’s the optimal diet for your plant? Try the three different nutrition formulas and discover which ones your plant character likes!\n\n● Cloning machine: Spin the wheel on the cloning machine and before you know it, you’ll have five little versions of your plant. Wonder what the clones can do? Experiment and find out!\n\n● Crossbreeding apparatus: Here you can mix two plants to create something unexpected. Try it and see what happens!\n\nHave fun experimenting at each station to see how the plants evolve.

"description":"Autism iHelp is a vocabulary teaching aid developed by parents of a child with Autism and a speech-language pathologist. Autism iHelp was inspired by the need for specific language intervention tools for children with Autism Spectrum Disorder  focusing on their unique strengths and difficulty with expressive vocabulary.\n\nAutism iHelp is an invaluable tool for your child with Autism when those first words just don’t come. The colorful real-life photos are presented in an easy-to-label format. \n\nThis app includes several features:\n\n- 24 real world photos; it has been proven that children with Autism respond best to photos as opposed to illustrations and are very visual learners. 24 photos chosen based on established expressive language milestones are divided into three sub groups of eight.  With 24 photos, over-stimulation is less likely which increases the child’s ability to grasp the concepts at an appropriate rate. \n- Labels of all photos with the option to turn off the label as some children with Autism may be more drawn to the written word. At the end of eight images there will be an option to try again, aiding in repetition and drill required for learning new words. \n- Option to have images presented at random or not, to additionally aid in generalization and concrete learning.\n- When audio is selected, two voice options are available—male and female.  This provides the most realistic experience for your child.  There will also be an option to turn the audio off, which would prompt your child to use his or her own voice and spontaneously label the learned words. \n- This app also includes two Learning Enhancement activities.  These learning activities are presented in a game-like format, and require the child to either match a picture to word given multiple word choices or choose the word that goes with the picture in a field of 4 pictures.  These games check retention of the learned vocabulary and integrate auditory and visual memory. Additionally, you are able to track your child's gains through progress reports that average the last 3 performances of each learning enhancement activity.\n\nAutism iHelp - Food app includes groups of fruits, vegetables, and everyday foods. Foods were chosen based on popularity among preschoolers, and healthy choices. These photos are very motivating and can be used for requesting a food or labeling a food.\n\n“with Autism iHelp…..it gets better.”", "bundleId":"com.jt.autismhelpfood", "releaseNotes":"minor bug fixes.", "primaryGenreName":"Education", "isVppDeviceBasedLicensingEnabled":true, "releaseDate":"2012-03-02T22:42:13Z", "sellerName":"John Talavera", "genreIds":["6017", "6016"], "currentVersionReleaseDate":"2017-11-17T22:54:47Z", "averageUserRating":4.5, "userRatingCount":8},

"description":"Dr. Gary Brown's Autism/DTT Letters app uses Discrete Trial Training (DTT) to help your child learn the letters of the alphabet (A-Z) and to learn the difference between uppercase and lowercase letters.  The letters can be viewed in a simple sans-serif font, serif font, handwritten print font, a cursive font and with several other new card sets.  The app also includes the letters in American Sign Language.  This app has been tested extensively in Dr. Brown's clinic with children who have autism, ADHD, and other developmental disorders.\n\nDTT is not a children's game. It is a therapy based on years of scientific research.  DTT is the primary teaching method used in Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) to teach numerous pre-academic and social skills to children with autism.  This app can be used to help teach the letters of the alphabet to children with autism, attention deficit disorder (ADD), attention deficit hyperactive disorder (ADHD), or any child who has trouble staying on task.\n\nFinding the right therapy for a child with autism can be overwhelming.  Only Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) has years of scientific research proving it's effectiveness and is recommended by The National Institute of Mental Health and the Surgeon General.  But caregivers quickly learn that well-trained therapists in ABA are expensive and hard to find.  During my forty years of clinical experience as a Licensed Psychologist I have tried to provide low-cost ABA resources for caregivers so they can do their own ABA.  ABA and DTT increases your child's likelihood of being mainstreamed, increases happiness, and gives you hope.\n\nBe sure to check out our other apps: \n* Autism/DTT Colors\n* Autism/DTT Shapes\n* Autism/DTT Numbers\n* Autism/DTT Site Words\n* Autism/DTT Animals\n* Autism/DTT People\n* Autism DX/Treatment\n* DTT Pro", "bundleId":"net.zbobbradley.dttletters", "releaseNotes":"Updated for iOS8 and iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus devices.", "primaryGenreName":"Education", "isVppDeviceBasedLicensingEnabled":true, "releaseDate":"2011-03-16T15:26:36Z", "sellerName":"Bob Bradley", "genreIds":["6017", "6020"], "currentVersionReleaseDate":"2015-05-07T16:24:14Z", "averageUserRating":4.5, "userRatingCount":11},

"description":"If you have a child with autism and are looking for a fun and interactive tool to engage with your child, look no further and download Aiko & Egor: Animation 4 Autism today!\n\nAiko & Egor (http://aikoandegor.org) is an animated video series and app developed by See Beneath, a California-based nonprofit.  Aiko & Egor displays simplified animation and engaging underwater characters and is intended to be watched together by children with autism and their family members, but is appropriate for many developmental levels and can be enjoyed by all children.  This app contains video content from Season 1 of Aiko & Egor, beginning with Episode 1.  \n\nEnjoy the engaging video content and practice developmental skills in the following ways:\n\n1) Play Video:  Select this button to watch the entire episode all the way through or choose a particular scene from the episode.  The Play Video feature is intended for the entire family to watch together but the videos are appropriate for a child to watch the video by his/herself or with siblings and/or friends.\n\n2) Learn Together:  Select this button to watch the same video content with learning opportunities or \"\"Bubble Times\"\" embedded at specific moments throughout the video.  The Learn Together feature should only be selected when the adult and child are watching the videos together.  During each Bubble Time, the video will pause and a menu will pop up that presents instructions for the learning moment.  The adult will then follow the instructions on the menu to appropriately facilitate the learning moment and either replay the preceding action by the character or continue playing the video.\n\n3) Skill Building (coming soon):  Select this button to practice particular skills that are modeled by the characters in the video.  This activity can be done by the child his or herself, but is better to be demonstrated or supervised by an adult so that the child is successful and does not get frustrated.\n\nBelow is an excerpt of a testimonial from Adrian Weaver, an Early Childhood Specialist who has been doing Habilitation therapy with children with autism since 2009:\n\"\"My client loves to watch videos in between work sessions...I have been looking for an alternative that is specifically designed for children with autism in mind.  I was happy to hear about Aiko & Egor at a time when I was actively looking for that very thing!...Things that I thought made the video particularly useful with my client were the use of familiar songs, the repetition of songs within a single video, the use of emotion...and the big eyes for the characters, which supports the goal of eye contact that we are currently working on!\"\"\n\nSee Beneath's co-founders have years of experience in autism research and intervention.  Aiko & Egor utilizes principles based on Video Modeling and Applied Behavior Analysis. Also, the series uses a modified curriculum based on the Early Start Denver Model and the Strategies for Teaching based on Autism Research curricula.  The See Beneath team is currently conducting research on the efficacy of the Aiko & Egor videos and appreciates any and all feedback (email info@seebeneath.org with feedback or for more info).\n\nIf you like what you read and see, learn more on our website:\nhttp://aikoandegor.org\n\nAnd follow Aiko & Egor on social media:\nfacebook.com/aikoandegor\ntwitter.com/aikoandegor", "bundleId":"com.seebeneath.aikoandegor",

"description":"Color In is a fun app developed for children with special needs to help them engage in expressive behavior and also understand the synchrony of natural colors. Bright colors leave a healthy impression on the pliant mind of young children, inspiring positive thinking and constructive activities. The app has two parts – training and play. \n\nThe app, with the aid of assistive technology for autism spectrum disorders, asks the user to apply colors to images of animals such as cat, dog, elephant, horse and lion. Built on the discrete trial part of applied behavior analysis aka ABA, it includes colorful audio-visual prompts and a highly interactive gameplay environment. \n\nIn the training part the child is shown how to fill colors before he or she is asked to do it himself or herself. The number of color inputs required to fill each image varies according to the intricacy of the sketch (the animal and background). At any point during an activity, the child can undo an input without losing on the count of steps remaining to complete filling all required colors and proceed to the next image. \n\nEach screen features a Help icon that tells the child the built-in color scheme for the corresponding image. However, the child is free to pick any color from the list of colors given with each image. An animation is played on successful completion of each step. This technique is based on the rule of positive reinforcement. \n\nParents, teachers or caregivers can set time and sequence of activities from the ‘Settings’ part of the app. The default time to complete applying colors to an image is 1 minute. \n\n***About WebTeam Corporation*** \n\nIncorporated in 2005, WebTeam Corporation is a Somerset-based mobile application development firm that has pioneered the development of an autism management program comprising screening, assessment and intervention apps. WebTeam’s ABA-based autism apps help parents, teachers, health care experts, researchers and other stakeholders worldwide efficiently manage the entire life-cycle of autism from infancy to adulthood and employment. \n\nBy developing apps for autism intervention, WebTeam replicates individualized autism services on mobile devices, thereby making these necessary services available to the under-served population globally, especially in countries that lack the expertise necessary to tackle autism efficiently and in a cost-effective manner. \n\nWebTeam’s innovative idea backed by proprietary technology, which was awarded by Verizon in the 2013 Powerful Answers Award competition, lets caregivers collect and share data efficiently to foster effective collaborations that will ultimately solve one of the world’s largest and growing developmental disorders.", "bundleId":"com.webteamcorp.com.ColorIn", "releaseNotes":"Functional Enhancements", "primaryGenreName":"Education", "isVppDeviceBasedLicensingEnabled":true, "releaseDate":"2013-01-04T01:23:10Z", "sellerName":"WebTeam Corporation", "genreIds":["6017", "6013"], "currentVersionReleaseDate":"2017-02-02T19:02:25Z", "averageUserRating":3.5, "userRatingCount":5},

"description":"Catalyst\nWireless | Paperless | Effortless\n\nBehavior Analysts have a new best friend! \n \nImagine if all of the administrative hassles of data collection and data management disappeared. We did . . . and then we built Catalyst. Join the thousands of behavior analysts around the world who have revolutionized their practice. \n\nCatalyst is the industry leading, state-of-the-art, mobile/cloud-based technology for collecting, managing, and using your data—by far the most comprehensive and flexible system available. Using Catalyst, a family or organization can completely eliminate (a) paper data sheets, (b) all of the time spent entering data, and (c) mountains of paper graphs.\n\nParents or professionals can then spend more time teaching, and program managers, such as BCBA’s, can access critical information quicker and much more efficiently. Quite simply, Catalyst allows users to spend less time with graphs and more time with learners.\n\nBut Catalyst is not just a data collection tool for your mobile device(s); it is not just an online system for data storage, management, graphing, and analysis. Catalyst is both! And, it works seamlessly to make your practice more efficient and more effective. Here’s how:\n\n1.\tDesign your own programming. Design the program(s) you want with nearly limitless combinations of customizations. And, because you define how Catalyst works for you, huge amounts of program down time can be eliminated. Catalyst will automatically move targets from baseline to acquisition to maintenance and back again, based on your preferences. Use cold probes, behavioral momentum, custom prompt levels, errorless teaching, and much more. Keep doing things the way you like, just do them better.\n \n2.\tTake Your Data. Whether you want a simple frequency counter or complex skill acquisition data, Catalyst is exactly what you are looking for. In fact, Catalyst can help you take the following types of data:\n•\tDiscrete Trials\t\t\t\n•\tTask Analysis (Forward/backward chaining)\n•\tEchoic Sounds\n•\tToileting Data\n•\tDuration\n•\tFrequency\n•\tBehavior event/ABC data\n•\tPartial Interval\n•\tWhole Interval\n•\tMomentary Time sampling\n•\tFluency/Rate\n•\tQuantity/Percentage\n•\tAnecdotal Information\n\nCatalyst can even help with timesheets, and it can do so offline or online. Now, you don’t need be to be tethered to paper or the internet!\n\n3.\tAnalyze Your Data. Love graphs? Let us help you nerd-out! Our online graphing engine is nuclear, allowing for dozens of different views of learner data, all customizable in real time. Users can sort data by different instructors, morning versus afternoon, “raw” numbers of trial counts during a day, average numbers of trials to mastery criteria, numbers of instructors who have recorded data, and much more. Catalyst can also help with reports, or it can combine graphs and reports into custom progress notes and insurance reports. All the information you need, all in real time with just a few clicks!", "bundleId":"com.compassautism.ipad",

"description":"Dr. Gary Brown’s Autism/DTT Color App uses Discrete Trial Training (DTT) to help your child learn the basic colors.  DTT is the primary teaching method used in Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) to teach numerous pre-academic and social skills to children with autism.  This app can be used to help teach the colors to children with autism, attention deficit disorder (ADD), attention deficit hyperactive disorder (ADHD), or any child who has trouble staying on task.\n\nChildren using this app will be able to learn the colors in Chinese, English, French, Norwegian or Spanish. Other language packs will be added soon! (Note, the startup and config screens of the app are currently in English only.) \n\nFinding the right therapy for a child on the autism spectrum can be overwhelming.  Only Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) has years of scientific research proving its effectiveness and is recommended by The National Institute of Mental Health and the Surgeon General.  But caregivers quickly learn that well-trained therapists in ABA are expensive and hard to find.  During Dr. Brown’s forty years of clinical experience as a Licensed Psychologist he has tried to provide low-cost ABA resources for caregivers so they can do their own ABA.  ABA and DTT increases your child's likelihood of being mainstreamed, increases happiness, and gives you hope.\n\nThis DTT App for teaching colors is fully automated and has been tested with children with autism at The Children's Treatment Center.  This app is designed to be very simple with no distracting stimuli because children with autism (and other disorders) are easily distracted. This app is not designed to be a general purpose game, but rather a clinically tested training approach for children with a specific type of learning disability.\n\nPlease check the app's website for more information about Autism, ABA and DTT.\n\nPlease try out other DTT and autism apps:\n- DTT Colors\n- DTT Shapes\n- DTT Letters\n- DTT Numbers\n- DTT Site Words\n- DTT Animals\n- DTT People\n- DTT Pro", "bundleId":"net.zbobbradley.ctc1", "releaseNotes":"Updated for iOS8 and iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus devices.", "primaryGenreName":"Education", "isVppDeviceBasedLicensingEnabled":true, "releaseDate":"2010-12-05T23:39:21Z", "sellerName":"Bob Bradley", "genreIds":["6017", "6013"], "currentVersionReleaseDate":"2015-04-22T20:05:44Z", "averageUserRating":4.5, "userRatingCount":11},

ABC and phonetic pronunciation can be selected exclusively or combined for complete immersion in the language of your choice.\n\nBecause we believe in providing a perfect environment for your children to pick up all the letter sounds, we have volume controls so you can reduce the background volume anytime you wish to have a more focused educational setting.\n\nAnother feature children enjoy is the ability to switch from lowercase to uppercase letters, as well as both uppercase and lowercase forms of the same letter. This allows children to familiarize themselves with letter forms and letter patterns.\n\nTurning each different letter brings joy and dynamism with different, carefully selected graphics that reinforce the current letter. These graphics can be tapped and moved around with physics which is always a favorite of our little beta testers.\n\nWhile most kids' alphabet apps consist of static flashcards, KIDpedia Alphabet provides an interactive environment that promotes learning, cause and effect, fine motor skills and engagement with every element in the screen.\n\nUsed by educators around the world, the interactive elements in our app provides an environment way for children to learn the alphabet and letter shapes by associating them with new words. They will be able to play with different animals and objects that appear on the screen stimulating learning and curiosity in a playful and colorful setting.\n\n\nKIDpedia: fun and intuitive way to learn the alphabet (ABC).", "bundleId":"com.choosecircle.alphabet", "releaseNotes":"Bug fixes", "primaryGenreName":"Education", "isVppDeviceBasedLicensingEnabled":true, "releaseDate":"2011-01-10T17:21:06Z", "sellerName":"KIDpedia Interactive", "genreIds":["6017", "6014", "7009"], "currentVersionReleaseDate":"2018-02-20T15:31:31Z", "averageUserRating":4.0, "userRatingCount":39},

"description":"This is the free version of VisTimer.  It is similar to the paid version, except the maximum timer setting is limited to 10 minutes.  The paid version has a maximum timer setting of 23 hours and 59 minutes.  It is also supported by advertising banners which are not present in the paid version.  The VisTimer was developed to provide a gentle implementation of time imposed limits.  It utilizes an animated shrinking pie chart to depict elapsed time.  Visual thinkers, especially when they are children, have difficulty conceptualizing time.  Being able to see the changing pie chart as time passes makes it easier to understand time and duration.  It is easy to explain to a child that when the circle is completely gone, an activity is finished or a task must be completed.  There is an Early Warning preference setting to indicate the timer is approaching completion.  This provides a gentle reminder to prepare and set expectations.  Even the color of the pie chart can be customized to a calming favorite color.  A large or small digital countdown display can be turned on or off.  Sleep mode (Auto-Lock) can also be disabled while the timer is running.  This keeps the VisTimer display visible for the duration of the countdown.  Sometimes allowing a child to participate in selecting these preferences creates a sense of ownership and commitment.  The VisTimer can also operate in Lock Mode, where all settings are locked after the timer is started.  This imparts it with a higher sense of authority and detaches its consequences from you.\n\nThe low stress animated circle combined with restful colors and gentle sounds also make it ideal for timing relaxation activities such as meditation and yoga.", "bundleId":"com.appspot.mindfultools.VisTimerFree", "releaseNotes":"VisTimerLite 1.3 has been updated to run on iOS 11.", "primaryGenreName":"Lifestyle", "isVppDeviceBasedLicensingEnabled":true, "releaseDate":"2011-09-09T02:01:27Z", "sellerName":"Gregory Ng", "genreIds":["6012", "6013"], "currentVersionReleaseDate":"2017-11-07T23:22:08Z", "averageUserRating":2.5, "userRatingCount":31},

"description":"Count It Easy is a learning game developed by WebTeam Corporation to assist parents and special educators in teaching basic counting skills to children with autism. The colorful, animated app is built on the principles of applied behavior analysis aka ABA.\n\nIn the gameplay session, the child is shown different animals and is asked to count the number of animals being shown. Each screen appears with n number of a single animal, together with three answers one of which is right.\n\nThe ABA method of intervention necessitates positive reinforcements on correct responses. Whenever the child makes a correct response, an animation is played as a reward of his or her performance.\n\nIn the app settings, the user can opt for training; set time and specify question order. There is an option called ‘Question Intro’ enabling which activates the sounds animals make. The basic purpose of this feature is to familiarize children with various animal sounds and offer them some fun as they learn.\n\nTotal score for a particular session is displayed at the end of an activity. The user can like or share the score on Facebook/Twitter, and may also rate the app on a scale of 1 to 5 stars.\n \n***About WebTeam Corporation***\n\nIncorporated in 2005, WebTeam Corporation is a Somerset-based mobile application development firm that has pioneered the development of an autism management program comprising screening, assessment and intervention apps. WebTeam’s ABA-based autism apps help parents, teachers, health care experts, researchers and other stakeholders worldwide efficiently manage the entire life-cycle of autism from infancy to adulthood and employment.\n\nBy developing apps for autism intervention, WebTeam replicates individualized autism services on mobile devices, thereby making these necessary services available to the under-served population globally, especially in countries that lack the expertise necessary to tackle autism efficiently and in a cost-effective manner.\n\nWebTeam’s innovative idea backed by proprietary technology, which was awarded by Verizon in the 2013 Powerful Answers Award competition, lets caregivers collect and share data efficiently to foster effective collaborations that will ultimately solve one of the world’s largest and growing developmental disorders.", "bundleId":"com.webteamcorp.com.CountitEasy", "releaseNotes":"- User Interface Fixes and Enhancements \n- Offers In App purchase options with parental gateway seeking parental permission for purchases", "primaryGenreName":"Health & Fitness", "isVppDeviceBasedLicensingEnabled":true, "releaseDate":"2013-01-16T01:52:47Z", "sellerName":"WebTeam Corporation", "genreIds":["6013", "6017"], "currentVersionReleaseDate":"2014-06-13T04:59:45Z"},

"description":"A work system is a strategy that addresses independence as an essential outcome for students with ASD. A work system, an element of structured teaching, is defined by Division TEACCH as a systematic and organized presentation of tasks and materials that visually communicates at least four pieces of information to the student (Schopler, Mesibov, & Hearsey, 1995):\n\n1. The tasks/steps the student is supposed to do. \n2. What is the nature of the task? \n3. How many tasks/steps there are to be completed. \n4. How the student knows he/she is finished. \n\nThe student should independently recognize the end of the activity through the structure within the task, use of a finished box, timer, or other visual cue such as a stop sign.\n\nWhat to do when he/she is finished. Indicate next scheduled activity. May need to use a highly desired item/activity to increase motivation, though often being “finished” is motivating enough.\n\nWhile a picture schedule directs a student WHERE TO GO, a work system instructs a student on WHAT TO DO once they arrive in the scheduled area. \n\nIn our own lives, a daily planner may direct us to the grocery store (our schedule), while our grocery list informs us what to do/buy while at the store (our work system). \n\nA work system provides all of the required information without adult prompting and teaches the student to attend to visual cues (rather than verbal directives) when completing a task. \n\nA work system assists in organizing a student with ASD by providing a systematic work routine—working from left-to-right or top-to-bottom. Students do not have to plan where to begin or how to proceed. \n\nWork systems can be used with any type of task or activity (e.g., academic, self-help, leisure), across settings (e.g., independent work area, cafeteria, place of employment), and for individuals at all functioning levels (e.g., systems can range from concrete to abstract).", "bundleId":"com.visualedvantage.worksystem", "releaseNotes":"- Better performance\n- Better scrolling", "primaryGenreName":"Education", "isVppDeviceBasedLicensingEnabled":true, "releaseDate":"2012-02-18T01:22:17Z", "sellerName":"Jared Yeo", "genreIds":["6017", "6002"], "currentVersionReleaseDate":"2013-03-21T23:54:31Z", "averageUserRating":2.5, "userRatingCount":10},

"description":"Do you ever struggle to make a group of children silent for a while? \n\nWith \"Too Loud Kids Noise Meter & Timer\" keeping the kids quiet will become fun and competitive. You set the timer duration, meter sensitivity and start the timer. While the time passes the voice meter measures and graphically shows the noise level. Behind the voice meter there is an animal which reacts to the voice level. When it is silent the animal looks happy and fun, but when the noise gets louder the animal and the background landscape is reacting accordingly to show graphically that the noise is too high. \n\nFeatures: \n• Voice meter with indicator showing if the noise level is low or high \n• Possibility to adjust the sensitivity and dampening of the voice meter – this app can be used not only when you want the kids to be absolutely quiet, but also when you accept a certain level of noise\n• Timer – you can set any duration from 10 seconds to 1,5 hour. \n• 6 background themes (cat with a house, monkey in a jungle, dolphin in a sea, lion on a desert, penguin on the South Pole) \n• Positive and negative marks – awarded when kids are silent or too loud \n• Sound effects \n• Possibility to record your own sound effects \n• Works with Bluetooth devices (speaker and recorder) \n\nWe created this app to make \"Be quiet!\" sound less abstract for our own children. We found it extremely useful and we do hope that you will find it useful too. \n\nIf you have any feedback or suggestions for new features please contact us. We would be happy to hear from you to be able to improve this app.", "bundleId":"com.idea4e.TooNoisyTimerLite",

"description":"“Speech with Milo” apps were created by a licensed Speech-Language Pathologist, and have been downloaded over 100,000 times. \"Speech with Milo: Verbs\" was created as a versatile and entertaining speech therapy tool for children. Milo is for speech therapists working with children, or parents who want to teach language skills to their children. The app offers an enjoyable tool used in therapy at a cheap price. \n\n* Nominated for the Mobile Premier Awards as THE outstanding education app.*\n\nSee a demo here:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EevXmw0Y0f4\n\n“Speech with Milo: Verbs” is centered on an adorable and energetic mouse named Milo.  Milo performs over 100 actions, such as “bounce,” “count,” and “play”.  This provides an engaging way to build up an action word vocabulary in the child.   Flash cards are typically used for this type of exercise, but the animation that comes with Milo will keep any child focused and attentive.  And most important- it is fun!  \n\nThe app comes with two sets of instructions- one for Speech Therapists and one for Parents.    This app can be used for infants and toddlers, as well as children with language delays.\n\nReviews :\n*****  \"Forget Micky Mouse; Milo is the most popular mouse in our house!\" (AutismEpicCenter.com)\n***** \"Excellent for Speech Therapy\" (Trisha C.- SLP)\n***** \"I look forward to future applications by Doonan Speech Therapy\" (GA SLP)\n(see more reviews under \"All Versions\")\n\nFeatures:\n•Used in therapy for children with special needs, such as:  Autism / Asperger Syndrome, Down Syndrome, developmental delays, cognitive delays, speech and language delays.\n•Fun and affordable\n•Milo, an animated mouse, keeps children interested and motivated to learn.\n•Instructions for Speech Therapists and Parents (in English only)\n•Verb is spoken as the action is completed to reinforce action with auditory input.  There is an option to turn this feature off.\n•Written verb is displayed at the bottom of the screen to reinforce reading skills.\n•Phrase button allows child to listen to a sentence using the verb.\n•Milo takes a break every once in a while with some cheese and a dance.  The child gets to feed Milo some cheese and watch him dance as a reward for his/her hard work.\n•You may customize the actions that Milo performs.  On List of Actions from the Home Page, you can do the following:  random order, alphabetical order, or select your own custom set of verbs to work on by touching the word(s) in list of actions to activate/deactivate blue button.\n•Background music can be turned off if it is too distracting for the child.\n\nNOTE:  THE APP IS ANIMATION INTENSIVE, WHICH MEANS IT MAY TAKE AS MUCH AS TWO MINUTES TO DOWNLOAD.  IT IS WELL WORTH THE WAIT!\n\nDoonan Speech Therapy is a member of Moms with Apps, a collaborative group of family-friendly developers seeking to promote quality apps for kids and families.\nRecommended Ages: 1-3,4-7, Parents\nCategories: Special Needs, Vocabulary\nVideo: http://youtu.be/EevXmw0Y0f4\n\nfor support issues: www.speechwithmilo.com", "bundleId":"com.milo.speech", "releaseNotes":"Support for latest OS updates", "primaryGenreName":"Education", "isVppDeviceBasedLicensingEnabled":true, "releaseDate":"2010-12-02T23:19:05Z", "sellerName":"Poorani Doonan", "genreIds":["6017"], "currentVersionReleaseDate":"2017-06-27T23:21:33Z", "averageUserRating":4.0, "userRatingCount":187},

Created by award-winning app designers, Kid in Story Book Maker makes it easy and fun to create visual stories to support learning, social modeling, and early literacy for all children. \n\nTESTIMONIALS\n“Kid in Story. Finally a GREAT Social Story App!” Shannon Rosa, Squidalicious\n\n“An excellent app if you are looking for more creative freedom in your child’s learning experiences.” KinderTown\n\n5 Stars – “I am impressed and found it difficult to write this review without saying ‘It’s so easy and fun!’ every other sentence. The truth is that it performs as promised, is attractive and no bugs were found while putting it through the motions.\" Technology in Special Education\n\n“By involving the child in making the social story, the child receives an in-depth social skills session and then the book can be sent to the child's parent or caregiver via email or Dropbox for ongoing reinforcement of the skills. We found the ability to customize the story by placing the child's photo into the scene to be highly motivating and engaging for all users.” BridgingApps\n\nRECOGNITION\nFeatured in App Store: Education: Play.Learn.Discovery., Special Education: Life Skills, and Accessibility: Learning & Literacy\n\nWHAT’S INSIDE KID IN STORY AND HOW DOES IT WORK? \nKid in Story Book Maker templates come to life when you place your child or student’s picture on every page. The 20 story templates cover a variety of practical and fanciful topics from promoting good hygiene by washing your hands, to a playful exploration of emotions and facial expressions, to a fantasy visit to San Francisco! Older children can also write their own custom story or modify any of the templates as they see fit.\n\nHere is how you can personalize the stories and share with friends and family:\nAdd your child’s photo into the story template background. Our unique Locolens™ image detection technology allows you to snap a portrait (or use one already saved in your library), and pluck your “kid” out of the picture and place him or her in the story. \nModify the story by editing the story templates\nRecord your own voice or the child’s voice as the narrator \nOnce complete, children will enjoy reading or playing their very own personalized visual story\nShare it with others via email, pdf, or Dropbox.\n\nWatch the demo: http://bit.ly/ZshJPB\n\nWHAT’S IN THIS FREE VERSION?\nCreate and share one story template and share (in-app purchase to have unlimited access)\nBrowse through other story templates from the Community Library\n\n20 Story Templates included in the Community Library:\nFaces I Make\nWhat Will I See in San Francisco?\nWhen Is It Time to Wash My Hands?\nLet’s Get A Haircut (boy)\nLet’s Get A Haircut (girl)\nThe Snow Day\nWe’re Going to a Hockey Game\nThe Three Bears and the Boy\nWe’re Moving House!\nFlummox and Friends and Me\nAll About Thanksgiving\nCooking with Chef Katie Smoothie Time!\nCooking with Chef Katie Breakfast Cereal\nAll About Hanukkah\nChristmas Around the World\nVisiting California\nAre Monsters Hiding in My Room? \nA Day at the Movies\nAt the Playground \nHalloween Winner?\n\nCHILDREN WITH SPECIAL NEEDS: We specifically designed Kid in Story Book Maker to benefit children who use social stories and visual narratives to complement auditory directions, model task analysis and expected social behavior, reinforce routines and to engage struggling readers. \n\nONLINE SAFETY: Kid in Story adheres to Children’s Online Privacy standards and does not contain any 3rd party advertisements http://enuma.com/policy/.\n\nABOUT ENUMA (FORMERLY, LOCOMOTIVE LABS): We design accessible games and applications that help all children learn independently.

"description":"SnapType helps students keep up with their peers in class even when their penmanship holds them back. Students can easily complete school worksheets with the help of an iPad or iPhone.\n\nWith SnapType, students can take a picture of their worksheets, or import worksheets from anywhere on their device. They can then use their iOS device keyboard to add text to these documents and print, email, or share their creations. It is the perfect solution for kids, and even adults, who struggle with their handwriting. Just read a few of our amazing testimonials:\n\n\"Dear Amberlynn, Thank you so much for creating this app. You have changed the way my 12 year old son with dyspraxia functions in school. He is more independent and I cannot thank you enough. Please continue to help kids like my son. You are changing lives. Thank you.\"\n\n\"Thank you for this ! I am going to talk to my sons teachers about this -you are a blessing ! I can honestly tell you that I have spent many hours crying inside an Hurting watching my son struggle to write pages of sentences and spelling words and other homework - to the point that I have stopped him and honestly wrote for him left handed to make it look more like a neater version of his because I could not take it anymore ! Thank you\"\n\n\"I just wanted to personally thank you for creating it, as this is an app that I use nearly every day with my son to do his homework. You have created an app with a simple interface, but with an incredibly powerful impact. Thank you.\"\n\n\"It is wonderful and something so simple yet so so so important for little guys like mine who cannot write BUT is learning to type and has so much to say and SHOW.\"\n\n\"We trialed SnapType with an 8-year old who is receiving school-based occupational therapy due to visual motor and visual perceptual issues. The biggest complaint from teachers about handwriting for this student was related to illegible answers on worksheets. The student quickly learned to take images of the worksheets with her iPad, upload them to the device and type in her answers. In addition to making her writing legible and eliminating issues with visual perceptual skills, the child's interest in the task was greatly improved, as was her pride in her work.\"\n\n\"Thank you so much Amberlynn. What a wonderful idea and gift to those kids that struggle with dysgraphia. I have converted many a workbook page for my son. This is WONDERFUL!\"\n\n\"Thank you, thank you, thank you. I'm a mother of twins. My son is autistic and my daughter has cerebral palsy. They are still only 2 and a half... but I'm sure they will both need and use this. The fact that you have also made it free and are paying for it out of pocket is just the sweetest thing ever. I read about this last night and cried tears of joy. You are amazing! And I'm going to be telling everyone who will listen about you, this story, and your app. Thank you again, I truly appreciate it!!”", "bundleId":"com.SnapTypeApp.SnapType",

"description":"Selected as the #2 Best Education App for Kids by Babble.com. “Speech with Milo” apps were created by a licensed Speech-Language Pathologist, and have been downloaded over 50,000 times.  \n\nMilo is back to bring you Sequencing exercises like you have never used before! Enjoy 35 dynamic sequencing exercises using animation to keep your child engaged.  Speech with Milo: Sequencing was created by a licensed Speech-Language Pathologist to help children develop sequencing and storytelling skills.  The adorable mouse Milo brings a friend along this time to entertain and help your child.  \n\n***** \"This app developer really understands what SLP's find valuable in an app that is used in a therapy setting.\"\n***** \"I use the Milo apps on a daily basis in therapy and the children remain engaged and truly enjoy playing and learning with Milo. This app is a must buy.\"\n\nBuild basic sequencing skills by ordering three cards showing Milo and Melvin performing a task.  For example, cards showing Milo  “Washing Hands” and “Going to the Movies” are presented in random order.  The child is tasked with putting the cards in order by dragging the images into the appropriate box (numbered 1-3).  Once the child has put the cards in order, they are provided with the option to play the animation demonstrating the sequence of events.  The app is provided with configurable options to view hints, hear the sentence aloud, ‘success’ sounds, etc.  Forget those $15 Sequencing cards at the educational stores- this is much more fun for your child.\n\nWatch the YouTube demo here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiZ-IBPC6gU\n\nSpeech with Milo first became popular amongst Speech-Language Pathologists and parents with apps to help children build language skills with Verbs and Prepositions.  The Verbs app represented the education category for the Mobile Premier Awards and was embraced by the parent community.  Now Milo returns to help build critical sequencing skills.\n\nThe app comes with a set of instructions written by a licensed SLP to help you work with your child.\n\nThese are the language skills you will be targeting with this app:\n•Sequencing\n•Storytelling and/or retelling\n•Time concepts “first,” “next,” and “last”\n•Increasing utterance length\n•Developing complex sentences\n•Improving grammatical skills\n\nEnjoy!!\n\nDoonan Speech Therapy is a member of Moms with Apps, a collaborative group of family-friendly developers seeking to promote quality apps for kids and families.\nRecommended Ages: 1-3,4-7,Parents\nCategories: Special Needs, Vocabulary\n\nFor support issues: www.speechwithmilo.com", "bundleId":"com.milo.sequencing", "releaseNotes":"Support for latest OS updates", "primaryGenreName":"Education", "isVppDeviceBasedLicensingEnabled":true, "releaseDate":"2011-04-19T01:00:04Z", "sellerName":"Poorani Doonan", "genreIds":["6017"], "currentVersionReleaseDate":"2017-06-19T21:56:14Z", "averageUserRating":3.5, "userRatingCount":165},

"description":"Category Therapy Lite gives you a sample of the types of activities available in the full app. Category Therapy is a professional speech therapy app that practices mental organization skills for individuals who have language problems due to stroke, brain injury, or developmental disorders. You’ll see why speech-language pathologists & families “absolutely love this app,” calling it “highly recommended,” “my go-to app for categories,” & “well worth it!” \n\nBETTER ORGANIZATION MEANS BETTER UNDERSTANDING\nWhen mental organization skills (the ability to group items & name common characteristics) are lost or damaged, it affects our basis for structuring & understanding the world. Category Therapy encourages re-learning categorization skills by providing unlimited therapy using evidence-based exercises on your mobile device. \n\nIMPROVE CATEGORIZATION SKILLS FROM SIMPLE TO COMPLEX \nCategory Therapy features four exercises: \nFind | Classify | Exclude | Add One \nand three levels of difficulty: \nConcrete | Subcategories | Abstract \n\nCategory Therapy helps patients develop categorization skills along a hierarchy from simple to complex. It was designed by a Speech-Language Pathologist as a stroke recovery tool and is perfect for people who have difficulty speaking or finding words. \n\n“What Category Therapy has managed to do is to collate four kinds of activities into one tight, comprehensive app & spruced it up with customizable field sizes, filtered target categories, cue types & best of all, difficulty levels that range from concrete to abstract categories.” — Carla C, SLP of iSPeakApp \n\nMAKE THE MOST OF THERAPY SESSIONS \nCategory Therapy fits within a collaborative rehab model, seamlessly linking the clinic to the home, while connecting therapists to families & clients. It’s a useful assessment tool for professionals to gain insight into the cognition & comprehension of non-verbal patients, and the comprehensiveness of the app allows for extended engagement & practice time. Category Therapy is simple & intuitive for both professionals and patients, providing more repetitions & faster improvements. \n\n“The ability to e-mail results makes therapy so much easier because you can focus your time on explaining why different choices were correct or incorrect & actually teach rather than have to write down results.” — Jessica C, SLP of Consonantly Speaking \n\nDETAILED DESIGN EMPOWERS USERS \nThe clean, high-contrast layout uses realistic photos, recorded voice & easy-to-read print. Interactive text & icons enable the user to hear an item, category, or instruction stated aloud. With 700 images in 70 categories, four activities with three levels, & multiple settings, the full app has literally thousands of unique exercises. \n\n“It will be a LONG time before you run out of content to use with one patient/student, & the app’s fantastic settings options will allow you to use it with a variety of individuals, regardless of cognitive abilities.” — Aubrey K, SLP of Speechie Apps \n\nCategory Therapy is valuable for learners of all ages & abilities. Try Category Therapy Lite for a small taste of how this app can add educational value to any rehab center, special education classroom, or speech clinic. \n\nTHE FOUNDATION OF ALL TACTUS THERAPY APPS \nWe believe that therapy should continue as long as you want to improve. We make apps that let you decide when, where, & how often you want to practice. \n* Use the same tools at home as are used in therapy \n* Adjusts to challenge you as you improve & measure progress \n* Affordable single purchase & no ongoing subscriptions \n\nWe believe that apps should make therapy easier for clinicians. \n* Fast access to high-quality, evidence-based materials \n* Ready-made customizable home programs \n* Detailed summaries in clinical language for fast reporting \n* Designed for collaboration & engagement between therapists, families, & clients", "bundleId":"com.tactustherapy.CategoryTherapyLite", "releaseNotes":"- fix for the app rarely freezing while answering questions in an activity", "primaryGenreName":"Education", "isVppDeviceBasedLicensingEnabled":true, "releaseDate":"2012-11-11T06:18:42Z", "sellerName":"Tactus Therapy Solutions Ltd", "genreIds":["6017", "6020"], "currentVersionReleaseDate":"2017-11-22T22:58:53Z", "averageUserRating":4.0, "userRatingCount":23},

"description":"Autism iHelp is a vocabulary teaching aid developed by parents of a child with Autism and a speech-language pathologist. Autism iHelp was inspired by the need for specific language intervention tools for children with Autism Spectrum Disorder  focusing on their unique strengths and difficulty with expressive vocabulary.\n\nAutism iHelp is an invaluable tool for your child with Autism when those first words just don’t come. The colorful real-life photos are presented in an easy-to-label format. \n\nThis app includes several features:\n\n- 24 real world photos; it has been proven that children with Autism respond best to photos as opposed to illustrations and are very visual learners. 24 photos chosen based on established expressive language milestones are divided into three sub groups of eight.  With 24 photos, over-stimulation is less likely which increases the child’s ability to grasp the concepts at an appropriate rate. \n- Labels of all photos with the option to turn off the label as some children with Autism may be more drawn to the written word. At the end of eight images there will be an option to try again, aiding in repetition and drill required for learning new words. \n- Option to have images presented at random or not, to additionally aid in generalization and concrete learning.\n- When audio is selected, two voice options are available—male and female.  This provides the most realistic experience for your child.  There will also be an option to turn the audio off, which would prompt your child to use his or her own voice and spontaneously label the learned words. \n- This app also includes two Learning Enhancement activities.  These learning activities are presented in a game-like format, and require the child to either match a picture to word given multiple word choices or choose the word that goes with the picture in a field of 4 pictures.  These games check retention of the learned vocabulary and integrate auditory and visual memory. Additionally, you are able to track your child's gains through progress reports that average the last 3 performances of each learning enhancement activity.\n\nAutism iHelp – Animals app includes pictures of farm animals, zoo animals, and common pets-- use for labeling, categorizing animals, and talking about the sounds they make.\n\n“with Autism iHelp…..it gets better.”", "bundleId":"com.au.animal", "releaseNotes":"Latest iOS version support.", "primaryGenreName":"Education", "isVppDeviceBasedLicensingEnabled":true, "releaseDate":"2012-04-13T21:44:21Z", "sellerName":"John Talavera", "genreIds":["6017", "6016"], "currentVersionReleaseDate":"2017-11-17T23:44:39Z", "averageUserRating":4.5, "userRatingCount":6},
